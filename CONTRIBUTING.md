## Building from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.85+** — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **GNU Make**- **pre-commit** — install via `pip install pre-commit`
### Build & Run

```sh
# First-time setup — install pre-commit hooks
make setup

# Debug build
make build

# Run the app
make run

# Optimized release build
make release

# Install to ~/.cargo/bin
make install
```

### All Make Targets

```sh
make help
```

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `setup` | Install pre-commit hooks |
| `build` | Compile debug build |
| `release` | Compile optimized release build |
| `run` | Build and run (debug) |
| `install` | Install binary to `~/.cargo/bin` |
| `test` | Run all tests |
| `lint` | Run clippy with strict warnings |
| `fmt` | Format all source files |
| `fmt-check` | Check formatting (CI mode) |
| `check` | Type-check without producing binaries |
| `audit` | Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities |
| `licenses` | Regenerate THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md |
| `watch` | Rebuild on file changes |
| `clean` | Remove build artifacts |
| `ci` | Run the full CI check suite |

### Running Tests

```sh
make test
```

### Linting & Formatting

```sh
make lint    # clippy — must pass with zero warnings
make fmt     # auto-format with rustfmt
```

## Code Style

- All repo operations go through `make` targets — don't run raw `cargo` commands in CI or docs.
- Run `make setup` after cloning to install pre-commit hooks.
- `make ci` must pass before any PR is considered.
- No new warnings allowed — `make lint` enforces `-D warnings`.
